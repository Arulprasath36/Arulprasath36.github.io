## Now I'm a programmer and here are some fun facts about me

* I have a *bachelors degree in Computer science* and I didn't even know to write a single line of code until I finish the degree. 

* My fiancee struggled for around two weeks to make me understand how the for loop works.

* When I was in college, one of my friends told, IT people use a special software to write code for them and you dont have to know the syntax. I believed and later came to know that magical software is nothing but *Eclipse*

* I will mug up the header files to be included for each program when I was in college.

* Last but not the least, during my college days, I swore, *I will not work in IT industry* even for one day

Thanks for reading and Good luck with the learning!
